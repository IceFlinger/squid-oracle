squid oracle 
stat.ink analysis tool

a poor attempt to recreate some of the older features the site had before move to splatoon 2
other future goals:
select team based on roster, stats, and map for a given match
weapon suggestions for certain rotations

how to use:
Battle data can be loaded from the menu or while starting program with flags:
-u [User]: Scrape battle data from [User]'s page on stat.ink
-f [File]: Fetch json battle data from given file
Using both will fetch data from the stat.ink user and immediately store it into the file

Working so far:
Filter all battles to specific map/modes and calculate winrates and kdr
Weapons with less than 10 battles show a negative winrate to sort them to the bottom of the list.
